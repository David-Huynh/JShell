User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
i) As a user, I want the shell to print the contents of a directory to a given path, so I know what files are in it.
j) As a user, I want the shell to print error messages whenever I cannot perform a desired task so I know what went wrong.
k) As a user, I want the shell to print documentation for certain commands, so I know how to use them.
l) As a user, I want to be able to echo a string onto the shell.
m) As a user, I want to be able to echo a string overwriting file in storage, to write files quickly.
n) As a user, I want to be able to echo a string into the end of a file in storage, to append data to files quickly.
o) As a user, I want to be able to display the contents of a certain file.
p) As a user, I want to be able to display the contents of a certain file in storage concatenated with another file.
