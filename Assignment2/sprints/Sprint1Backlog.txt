User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to access a shell that's connected to a storage system.
b) As a user, I want to exit the shell when I am finished with it.
c) As a user, I want to create new directories in storage, so I may use then for storage in the future.
d) As a user, I want to change the current directory of the shell to another, so I may work in the directory I desire.
e) As a user, I want the shell to print the contents of the current directory.
f) As a user, I want the shell to print the current directory, so I know where I'm working in.
